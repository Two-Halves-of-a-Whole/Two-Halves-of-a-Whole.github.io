			Hello everyone!<br/>
			Welcome to our Website and here are some things about my boyfriend and me:<br/>
			(Gene is <b>Silverlion2004</b>, and Kaylyn is <b>UniGamerGirlâ™¡ðŸ¦„</b>)
			<br/>
			Kaylyn is 18, Gene is 19, and they both love gaming and editing videos on YouTube.
			<br/>
			Kaylyn has a condition called hydrocephalus and she has a shunt permanently implanted in her brain that functions to keep her alive and drains off the excess spinal fluid caused by her condition.<br/>
			She is doing very well after her shunt placement when she was 2 years old.<br/>
			Gene has four mental disabilites: ADHD, Asperger's Syndrome, Anxiety, and Depression. But he doesn't let that slow him down.</p>
			<br/>
			Kaylyn had first made her YouTube video around April in 2022, and Gene had made his first video in May 2022.<br/>
			Gene has around 19 subscribers and 2k channel views, whereas Kaylyn has around 1.36k subscribers and 100k views.<br/>
			Kaylyn is a Roblox youtuber that does gaming videos and shorts (mostly about Roblox but occasionally other games). She also likes to play games like <b>Adopt Me</b> or <b>BrookHaven</b>.<br/>
			Gene likes to upload Gaming videos / montages, Bloopers and animations. He has also said that his videos are <b>family friendly unless specified otherwise</b>.<br/>
			<br/><br/>
			We hope you enjoy our website, and have a nice day!
